                The louisiana website has a lot of text and explanations under each header that speaks the user's language
                and mostly makes it very clear and easy to understand what is meant.</p>
            
            
     
               Some words that are used is probably easy to understand for current students,
               like Ulink and La Louisiana, but makes no sense for
               prospective students and family etc. However when clicking the links you understand really fast what they are about.
               I also think that a school website, or other websites, can have some internal names as
               long as it makes sense to the current students.
            <p>
                Another insecurity I get is what Alumni, donors and friends mean. Is it friends of the school, or friends of the students.
                This is a bit unclear
