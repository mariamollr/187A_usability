                   The Louisiana website has a good match between the system and the real world. The site has a
                    lot of text and explanations under each header that speaks the user's language
                    and makes it very clear and easy to understand what is meant. However there are a few words that can be a bit confusing,
                    I have discussed them below.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Some words that are used are probably easy to understand for current students,
                   like 'Ulink' and 'La Louisiana', but makes no sense for
                   prospective students and family etc. However when clicking the links you understand really fast what they are about.
                   I also think that a school website, or other websites, can use some internal names as 
                   long as they are commonly used by the current students.
                <p>
                    Another insecurity is what Alumni, donors and friends mean. Who are the friends?
                    Is it friends of the school, friends of the students or something else.
                    Also the word academics I find old- fashioned and not a word used by students today.
                    A better term could be education, which I think most people would call it.
