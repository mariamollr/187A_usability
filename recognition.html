                <p>
                    I find it difficult to recognize where I am when clicking around. When I am in the news page,
                    there is an overhead saying 'communications and marketing' when it obviously should say 'news'
                    to make it consistence and possible to recognize which page you are at.
                    Also some of the different links link to the same page, like 'student life' at the top and
                    'current students' to the right. The overhead at this page says 'current students'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'visitors' link to the right of the page opens a page with the overhead 'about us'
                    and you wouldn't have a clue where you are. I would again guess that it was the same page as
                    the 'about us' link at menu-bar at the top of the page, but these two are distinct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another recognition problem at this site is all the different menus it has.
                    When entering either of the links in the horizontal menu-bar at the right side, another menu is presented.
                    This also has 'home' as one of it's links. When clicking 'home', 'welcome', 'area profile', 'history',
                    'excellence' or 'contact us' five different pages is presented, all with the title 'about us'.
                    If you click the 'fast facts' link, the menu-bar changes and the overhead says
                    'communications and marketing'. At least it has a second title saying 'For Media: Fast facts'.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Since this site has so many links and pages without any indication of where you are it seems
                    impossible to find what you are looking for and equally hard to analyze all of the problems.
                    Another example is when you are located at the 'current students' page there are some options
                    to choose among like 'freshman students' and 'reentry students'. The 'freshman students' page is called
                    'admissions and enrollment service', but has the same layout as before.
                    When entering 'reentry students' however, a whole new layout is presented. This problem blur into consistency
                     and have also been discussed there, but this problem also makes it very hard to recognize where you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The menu options are not highlighted or marked in any way that would help recognize which page you are at. Only
                    when hovering the mouse over a link the colors change or a symbol is presented next to it and the mouse icon change to a pointing hand.
