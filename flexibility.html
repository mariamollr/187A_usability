            The site does not promote accelerated navigation for experienced users. When I return to the site the links that I visited last
            time are not highlighted and unfinished forms cannot be saved for later. Returning users will have an advantage of recall but
            this is not necessarily an advantage for the site. If the developers had been focusing on recognition rather than recall the users
            would not have to visit the site multiple times in order to get to know their way around. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of texts and links that you have to read to find what you are looking for. A lot of the links sends you off to
            an external page and you have to click your way back using the navigation provided by the browser. When navigating internally,
            you can always go back to the home page, or the main menu choices by direct linking, but you cannot always get back to the previous
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site has a lot of contact information that is easy to find from the home page. Every department is listed with email address,
            telephone number and postal addresses. The amount of information is however unstructured.
            The overwhelming amount of poorly categorized information and the navigation weaknesses slows the efficiency down.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the URLs are of varying levels of easiness. Most of them are long and hard to remember. A lot of them also has a
            .shtml suffix that could have been dropped. Nor does the site provide functions to help users bookmark pages or make Louisiana.edu
            their homepage.
