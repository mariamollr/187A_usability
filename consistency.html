        The biggest and most noticeable error on the louisiana website is the lack of consistency.
        I'll start with the home page. It looks okay but has many different menus.
        The problem is the menu at the bottom of the page, like 'search' and 'index a-z' etc. When clicking any link
        at the home page, the menu I just mentiond moves to the top right of the page and the colors in 'Ulink' changes.
        This makes it difficult from the start to get familiarized with the site. A menu like this should be placed in a
        fixed location. The other menu at the top also changes backgorund color from yellow to red.

        The next inconsistency I noticed is the differences between the pages of the menu options'news', 'about us', academics, etc.
        'News' and 'About us' have the same layout, with the menu options on a dark yellow background that turns red when hovering over,
        red menu headlines and black text under it. When entering the 'academis' page there is another layout with no highlighted background,
        black menu headlines and a submenu under it written in red and the links are underlined. 
    </p>

        Even the menu at the 'academics' page is inconsistent with itself. Some of the menu options dont have a submenu so the menu headline is instead
        a red link that is underlined. The only consistency they use is that the all links are red and underlined, but when some menu
        headlines are black and some are red links, it looks very messy and it makes me want to leave the page. The 'student life' page and the
        'athletics' page also use this layout. The worst is that both of these pages have some menu headlines that are links, but they also have
        submenus under them that are not!

        The research page has again a totally different layout and use different colors. I am not sure why this is so different and to get back to
        where you were you must click the 'university website' that is written in small text at the top left of the page. Intuitively I thought
        I would get back by clicking the louisiana logo or the 'home' link. It seems like there have been 3 different people making this page without
        communicating.
