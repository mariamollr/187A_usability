                   The biggest and most noticeable error on the Louisiana website is the lack of consistency.
                    I'll start with the home page. It looks okay but has many different menu- bars.
                    One problem is the menu- bar at the bottom of the page, with 'search' and 'index a-z' etc.
                    When clicking any link at the home page, the menu I just mentioned moves to the top right of
                    the page and the colors in 'Ulink' changes. This makes it difficult from the start to get
                    familiarized with the site. A menu like this should be placed in a fixed location.
                    The same happens with the menu in the middle of the page, it moves to the right when entering a new page.
                    The other menu- bar at the top starting with 'news' also changes background color from yellow to red.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The next inconsistency I noticed is the differences between the pages of the menu options  'news', 'about us',
                    'academics', etc. 'News' and 'about us' have the same layout, with the menu options on a dark yellow
                    background that turns red when hovering over, red menu headlines and black text under it.
                    When entering the 'academics' page there is another layout with no highlighted background,
                    black menu headlines and a submenu under it written in red and the links are underlined.
                    This is also the case with the menu in the right, 'prospective students', 'current students' etc. They use two
                    different layouts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the menu at the 'academics' page is inconsistent with itself. Some of the menu options don't have a
                    submenu so the menu headline is instead a red link that is underlined.
                    The only consistency they use is that all the links are red and underlined, but when some menu
                    headlines are black and some are red links it looks very messy and it makes me want to leave the page.
                    The 'student life' page and the 'athletics' page also use this layout.
                    The worst is that both of these pages have some menu headlines that are links, but they also have
                    submenus under them that are not!
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    The 'research' page has again a totally different layout and use different colors.
                    I am not sure why this is so different and to get back to where you were you must click the
                    'university website' that is written in small text at the top left of the page. Intuitively I thought
                    I would get back by clicking the Louisiana logo or the 'home' link. Also the 'library' page use a different layout.
                    It has the same colors, but is not inside a frame like the rest of the site.
                    Under the 'student life' page there is a link to 'reentry students', again this page has
                    a whole new layout. It seems like there have been many
                    different people making this website without communicating. The color red is used through the
                    different layouts, but with different red tones. Another problem with these different layouts are that the
                    menu at the top is removed and there is no way to navigate back to the start page.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another problem is the names and titles on the websites that are used. When clicking 'news' the page
                    that opens is called 'communications and marketing' when you would expect it to be called
                    'news'. To get to 'news' you have to click one more link. Also the 'academics', 'student life' and 'visitors'
                    pages have another title than expected. The names of the menu- options are poor and should meet the
                    users assumption of what the page presents.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The site has different ways to indicate that something is a link. When hovering the mouse over a
                    link the icon always turns into a pointing hand, but some places the background color changes and other
                    places an icon next to the link is presented. Some links are also underlined. So there is
                    clearly a huge lack of consistency throughout the whole website.
