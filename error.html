          <em>"Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

            I have looked at set of forms to see how they prevent errors. One of them is the login form on Ulink. From the very beginning,
            the user is informed that the password is case sensitive. The site also has a link named 'What username and password do I use
            to access ULink?'. Here the user finds information on what username and password to enter. I believe that the user will try and
            maybe fail before noticing and pressing this link. If the information regarding which username and password to use was presented
            next to the login form, even more errors could have been prevented. Once I clicked on the link there was no navigation at all
            provided by the site and I was forced to use the browser navigation in to get back to the login form. It also took me some time
            to notice the error message after typing in a wrong username and password.  
          </p>

            Under 'prospective students' there is a linked image that encourages prospective students to sign up for a personalized page.
            This link opens a form titled 'send me stuff', and the descriptive text 'This page is for prospective students wishing to request
            more information about UL Lafayette'. So what happened to the personalized page? I am confused. However, the form provides the
            user with proper, understandable field names and is divided into logical sections that breaks up the form. The cursor moves according
            to my expectations and the required fields are marked with a star.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another form that provides validation feedback is the 'class schedule' form. This input feedback could have been more descriptive.
            In over half of the searches I tried out, I received an error message saying that the subject is not offered in the chosen term.
            This could have been avoided be making the user choose the term first, and then sort the course list based on the chosen term.
          </p>
          <p>
            The library comment form only gives an error message if you don't fill in the correct code that is provided on the page. The users are
            however not required to fill inn anything else. I assume that this leads to a lot of meaningless comments. Nor is it a second step that
            lets the user confirm their comment.
