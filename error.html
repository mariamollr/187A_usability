            I have looked at set of forms to see how they prevent errors. One of them is the login form on Ulink. From the very beginning,
            the user is informed that the password is case sensitive. The site also has a link named 'What username and password do I use
            to access ULink?'. Here the user finds information on what username and password to enter. I believe that the user will try and
            maybe fail before noticing and pressing this link. If the information regarding which username and password to use was presented
            next to the login form, even more errors could have been prevented. Once I clicked on the link there was no navigation at all
            provided by the site and I was forced to use the browser navigation to get back to the login form. It also took me some time
            to notice the error message after typing in a wrong username and password.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Under 'prospective students' there is a linked image that encourages prospective students to sign up for a personalized page.
            This link opens a form titled 'send me stuff', and the descriptive text 'This page is for prospective students wishing to request
            more information about UL Lafayette'. So what happened to the personalized page? I am confused. However, the form provides the
            user with proper, understandable field names and is divided into logical sections that breaks up the form. The cursor moves according
            to my expectations and the required fields are marked with a star.
          </p>
          <p>
            The library comment form gives an error message only if you don't fill in the correct code that is provided on the page. The users are
            however not required to fill inn anything else. I assume that this leads to a lot of meaningless comments. Nor is it a second step that
            lets the user confirm their comment. The error message does not promote error recovery and the users have to navigate back to the form by using
            the browser-provided navigation.
          </p>
            The library comment form has a 'start over' button that promotes user control, but I have to clear the text fields myself before I can
            start typing in anything, which is very inconvenient. When the form is sent the user is provided by two choices, 'go back' or 'go forward'.
            When the user has sent his/her comment I don't see why they would want to go back to the comment form again. The 'go forward' link,
            on the other hand, does not work at all which gives an incomplete impression of the site.
