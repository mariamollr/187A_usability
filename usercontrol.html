        <h2>User control and freedom:
          <em>"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state
          without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo."</em>

        <p>
          The site has a search function and its link is globally available in the top menu. When clicking the link a search field appears.
          When I have performed a search this search field disappears and I have to click the link again in order to perform another
          search.
        </p>

          There is no way of getting back from the library page without using the back button provided by the browser. (bilder)
          This is also the case with a lot of other pages. For example the academic success center site, the alumni association site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The library comment form has a start over button that promotes user control, but I have to clear the text fields myself
          before I can start typing in anything, which is very inconvenient. (bilde) When the form is sent the user is provided by
          two choices, go back or go forward. The go forward link does not work. There is no way that I have found to view your comment
          or to redo it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no print button provided by the site.
        </p>

          Campus map takes the user to a whole different site with no linking back to the university site. You simply have to click
          the back button in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site has a lot of contact information that is easy to find from the home page. Every department is listed with email
          address, telephone number and postal addresses. The amount of information is however unstructured and overwhelming. The
          information could have been categorized further to make it easier for the user to find what he/she is looking for.
