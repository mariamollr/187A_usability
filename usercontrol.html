        <h2>User control and freedom:
          <em>"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state

          <p>
            One of the main issues regarding user control and freedom is the inconsistencies in the site navigation. As mentioned this makes it
            hard for the users to get familiar with the site and makes them rely on recall rather than recognition. However, louisiana.edu does
            have a global navigation bar that is available at all times as long as you don't hit an external link. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The global menu bar contains a 'search' link. The user has to click on the link in order to get a search field presented,
            which is unnecessary and cumbersome, and could easily have been improved by placing the search field itself in the menu bar. Another
            inconvenience is that the search field disappears when a search has been started and I have to click the menu link again in order to
            perform another search.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue is that the library choice in the menu links to an external page with no obvious way back to the university site, except
            from the navigation provided by the browser. This is also the case with other external pages, such as the 'Academic Success Center' site
            and the 'Alumni Association Site'. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The library comment form has a 'start over' button that promotes user control, but I have to clear the text fields myself before I can
            start typing in anything, which is very inconvenient. When the form is sent the user is provided by two choices, 'go back' or 'go forward'.
            When the user has sent his/her comment I don't see why they would want to go back to the comment form again. The 'go forward' link,
            on the other hand, does not work at all which gives an incomplete impression of the site. Neither have I found a way to view or redo
            a comment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site has a lot of contact information that is easy to find from the home page. Every department is listed with email address,
            telephone number and postal addresses. The amount of information is however unstructured and overwhelming. The information could have
            been categorized further to promote user control and freedom. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Like with the library page, there is no linking back to the university site from the campus map. You simply have to click the back button
            in the browser. The map is however a pdf which promotes printing. The browser, not the site itself, provides the printing option.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Louisiana University site also has an interactive campus map but this is very well hidden. You can find it by following the path from
            'prospective students' to 'freshman students' and under the heading 'visiting campus' there is a link called 'interactive campus map'.
            The map takes a long time to load and once I clicked on a building I had to use the browser navigation to get back to the map. Other than
            that the map provides user freedom and is a funny way to get to know the campus, if you can find the map in the first place.
