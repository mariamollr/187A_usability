                    The Louisiana website has a lot of text and information at each page that makes the site
                    look meesy and unclear. There are so many different menus and they sometimes change location.
                    Some links in the different menus link to the same page, this contradicts to the rule of minimalist design.
                    They need a new hiearchy system of the menus that users can actually understand without getting frustrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is so much explanation under some of the menu options. If they feel they need so much text to
                    explain what it is, they should probably change the name of the menu options. The menus and the page title are
                    located at the top and to the right of the site with the details below. Although too much details
                    at most of the pages and then occasionally a new menu is presented under the page title.
                    The use of white space is not very good, for example the title is placed a bit to the right of the middle of
                    the page crossing the natural lines of the page.
                    The same can be said about the text at the bottom of the pages before the footer. This text and the title
                    could be placed in a way that would give more space and make the site look cleaner.
